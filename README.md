# IRC

ft_irc is a project developed as part of the curriculum at 42, creating our first self-made IRC server, capable of connecting using real IRC clients

## Usage

### Starting the Server

To start the server, simply execute the following command:

```bash
make
```

This will compile the necessary binaries.

### Running the Server

After compiling, use the generated binaries to execute the server. You need to specify the port and password for the server.

```bash
./ircserv <port> <password>
```

### Connecting with an IRC Client

Now, you can use an IRC client of your choice to connect to this server using the specified port and password.
